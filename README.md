# WinGet-Wrapper  
A PowerShell script to install/manage applications using WinGet - Common use case include InTune, and other endpoint management products.Â´ 
Detection script available for fixed version and for dynamic version (automatically matches the installed version with version available with WinGet)

* Can Dynamically find the WinGet directory to be used under System Context.
* Installation under User Context is supported
* Kill selected process before WinGet command
* Detection script that dynamically finds latest package available trough WinGet
* Logs to $env:ProgramData\WinGet-WrapperLogs (Usually C:\ProgramData\WinGet-WrapperLogs) 
* Detection script performs automatic cleanup of log files older than 60 days.

## Background / Why?
WinGet have a few limitations in terms of automation and is not integrated with common endpoints management products.  
System Context is not possible by using "winget" as the .exe location must be found and this location is not static due to versioning in the directory name.

## Requirements
Newer Windows OS build that includes the WinGet natively in the OS   
Windows 10 20H2 or newer should be enough

## WinGet-Wrapper.ps1

#### Usage:
>.\WinGet-Wrapper.ps1 -PackageName "Packagename used in log entry" -Context "User or System Context" -StopProcess "kill process using Stop-Process (.exe for the most part is not needed)" -ArgumentList "Arguments Passed to WinGet.exe"

## WinGet-WrapperDetection.ps1
Matches locally installed version with newest available version using WinGet or specified exact version specified.  
Can be setup to accept newer installed version locally $AcceptNewerVersion  
AutoUpdate options available to automatically keep application updated. (Actually not needed for "required" deployments)

## Usage (InTune)
In InTune create an Windows app (Win32) and upload WinGet-Wrapper.InTuneWin as the package file.  
>**Install:** .\WinGet-Wrapper.ps1 -PackageName "VideoLAN.VLC" -Context "System" -StopProcess "VLC" -ArgumentList "install --exact --id VideoLAN.VLC --silent --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements --scope machine"  

>**Uninstall:** .\WinGet-Wrapper.ps1 -PackageName "VideoLAN.VLC" -Context "System" -StopProcess "VLC" -ArgumentList "Uninstall --exact --id VideoLAN.VLC --silent --accept-source-agreements --scope machine"

Change the $id variable to match the package id in the detection script and upload it  ($id = "VideoLAN.VLC")  
  *If specific version is required change the $TargetVersion (Ex. $TargetVersion = "1.0.0.0")*  
  *To enable auto update set AutoUpdate to $True*
  *To define the Arguemnts passed to WinGet update $AutoUpdateArgumentList variable* 
  *To stop a process before updating update the $AutoUpdateStopProcess (ex. vlc  - do not add .exe)* 
  *To define under which context to install set the $Context to either System or User*
